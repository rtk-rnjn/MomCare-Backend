🔁 Step-by-Step Meal Creation (One Meal at a Time):

You must generate meals one by one in this exact order:
	1.	✅ Breakfast
	2.	✅ Lunch
	3.	✅ Snack
	4.	✅ Dinner

For each meal:
	•	Filter from mealDataset where mealType matches current step
	•	Exclude meals if:
	•	❌ Any item in ingredients or allergyIngredients appears in foodTolerance
	•	❌ Meal was used in mealHistory
	•	❌ Meal violates dietType

✅ Only after filtering, choose the most nutritionally appropriate meal
→ Then move to the next step and repeat the process for the next meal.

❗Each step must complete — never skip a meal. If no meal is available after filtering, retry until one is found.
