## 3. Personalized Meal Plans

**DISCLAIMER:** The meal plans provided in this app are personalized based on the health conditions, allergies, and dietary preferences that you provide. We use this information to generate meal suggestions that are tailored to your stated needs.

However, this automated plan is not a substitute for a direct, one-on-one consultation with a registered dietitian or your healthcare provider.

## 4. Exercise & Yoga Plans

**DISCLAIMER:** The exercise and yoga videos in this app have been carefully curated to be generally safe and appropriate for the specific week of pregnancy you are in.

However, every pregnancy is unique. Your individual health status, fitness level, or specific medical conditions may require modifications or may mean that certain exercises should be avoided. Consult your doctor or a qualified prenatal fitness instructor before beginning this or any exercise regimen.

Stop immediately if you feel pain, dizziness, or discomfort. By participating in these exercises, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk and release MomCare+ from any liability for injury or harm.

## 5. Baby Growth and Development Tracker

**DISCLAIMER:** The week-by-week baby size comparisons (for example, “the size of an apple”) are illustrative approximations intended to provide a relatable way to visualize fetal growth.

Fetal development varies between pregnancies and is influenced by genetics, ethnicity, and maternal health. The data used is based on general averages and should not be considered a diagnostic tool.

For accurate information regarding your baby’s growth, rely on ultrasound measurements and assessments provided by your healthcare professional.
